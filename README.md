## Overview

CineMate provides a user-friendly interface to browse movies, view detailed information such as synopsis, genres, and production companies, and watch trailers directly within the app. It utilizes [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for fetching movie data including now playing, popular, top-rated movies, and more.

## Design Architechture - Model–view–presenter(MVP) 
CineMate uses the Model–view–presenter (MVP) is a derivation of the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern which mostly used for building user interfaces MVP is an architecture pattern that you can use to deal with some of the shortcomings of MVC, and is a good alternative architecture. It provides an easy way to think about the structure of your app. It provides <b>modularity, testability and, in general, a more clean and maintainable codebase</b>.

Picking apart the acronym, MVP is composed of the following components:


- **Model**: Your model package contains classes like <b>, Movies, NowPlaying, Popular, etc., </b> bwhich are likely used to represent data retrieved from the API and interact with the database or backend.
  
- **View**: Activities  <b>(AnimeSplashActivity, MainMenuActivity, MovieDetailActivity, etc.)  </b>and Fragments <b> (HomeFragment, MovieDetailFragment, NowPlayingFragment, etc.) </b> serve as the UI components that interact with the user and display data.

- **Presenter**: While not explicitly named "presenter," the logic in your viewmodels  <b>(MovieViewModel, TrendingViewModel, etc.)  </b> can act as presenters, handling the business logic, coordinating data retrieval from models, and updating views accordingly.

### MVP Characteristics:

- **Modularity**: Components like activities, fragments, models, and viewmodels are modular, making it easier to maintain and test individual parts of the application.

- **Testability**: MVP facilitates unit testing by separating business logic (presenter/viewmodel) from UI components (activities/fragments), allowing for easier isolation of logic for testing.

- **Maintainability**: By separating concerns, MVP improves code readability and maintainability, as each component has a clear responsibility.
